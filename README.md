This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## NOT HOTDOG APP

## Technologies used:

• React
• Redux
• Clarifai API (to identify & classify the images)
• Unsplash API (to get random photos)
• Axios
• SCSS

## How the app works:

• User pastes an image URL to identify whether the image is or is not a hotdog.
• User selects the option to get a random photo, which would then be identified as a hotdog or not a hotdog.

## Future features:

• Add a file input, which would be uploaded to Cloudinary to get an image URL. This image URL would then be sent to Clarify to identify and classify the image.
